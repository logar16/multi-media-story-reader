# Story Time

## TODOs
* Story Editor
  * Give option to create stories with multimedia content and reactions to user actions.
    * This is not another text editor.  It's a story with links and media and some fun formatting, but not a full-powered text editor.
  * Make it easy to type in normal text or copy paste from another editor
    * Handle tabs and text formatting...
  * Make it easy to add in custom react components
* Story Reader
  * Fade in text.  See this [StackOverflow answer for some tips](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61018317)
  * Trigger actions to play music or show images or additional text etc.
  * Take advantage of the [special Markdown rendering library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx)
* Accounts
  * Save where you left off
  * Create and submit your own stories
  * Admin account
